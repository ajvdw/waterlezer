# Waterlezer

PLEASE NOTE: This repository is for reference only, the current firmware is under construction....

Waterlezer integrates your water meter seamlessly into Home Assistant. Plug and play, no coding necessary. It comes pre-installed with ESPHome code. After joining it to your WiFi it will be recognized in Home Assistant and can be added easily.

The WaterLezer is designed to work an home automation system but the current integration is for HomeAssistant.

ESPHome based
WaterLezer is powered by ESPHome. The code is opensource and can be found on my GitHub page for waterlezer. Here you can find a default yaml file as it is used for the precompiled firmware.
