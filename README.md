# Waterlezer

### HomeAssistant
Waterlezer integrates your water meter seamlessly into Home Assistant. Plug and play, no coding necessary. It comes pre-installed with calibration firmware. After joining it to your WiFi it will, you can calibrate the device easily.
The WaterLezer is designed to work with any home automation system but the current integration is for HomeAssistant only.

### ESPHome
WaterLezer is powered by ESPHome. The code is opensource and can be found on my GitHub page for waterlezer. Here you can find a default yaml file as it is used for the precompiled firmware.
